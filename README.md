# flicker-api-app
This is a simple single page application which lets the user search flicker pictures and create galeries of those images
I have used the Javascript EcmaScript 2015 language specifications.

#usage
Just open the application and start typing a keyword. Then, press the ENTER key or the search button to get the results. Each picture returned can be added into the gallery by simply clicking the 'Add To Gallery' button and removed by clicking 'Remove From Gallery'. When done creating the gallery collection press the button 'View Gallery' at the top right corrner of the application.

Currently the app is also hosted in the following address:
